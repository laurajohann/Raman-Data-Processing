Naming files convention: [process] [simulant] [vol%] ([sample #])--Spectrum--###--Spec.Data 1.txt
where the [ ] indicates places to input your sample information
- process: manufactoring process (e.g. DLP)
- simulant: LMS or LHS
- vol%: If a composite enter vol% or wt% of powder in matrix
- sample #: Whatever other identifying tag your sample has
  
Note: '--Spectrum--###--Spec.Data 1.txt' is automatically added to your file name from the WITec program, just be sure to define the sample name (i.e. [process] [simulant] [vol%] ([sample #]) in the program before experiment. 

For example, after naming my 'DLR LMS (R3)' sample, every profile I obtain is automatically given an ID by the program, so my first one would be given the 000 ID. Once I export the profile, the program saves the file as 'DLR LMS (R13)--Spectrum--000--Spec.Data 1'
